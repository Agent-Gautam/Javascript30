As for making your project look attractive, consider the following ideas:

Color Scheme: Choose a visually appealing color scheme. You can use different colors for white and black keys to mimic a real piano.

Key Shapes: Experiment with key shapes, such as rounded corners or unique designs for a modern and appealing look.

Add Labels: Label the keys with their corresponding notes (C, D, E, etc.) to make it user-friendly.

Hover Effects: Implement hover effects to make the keys interactive. They can change color or display tooltips when the mouse hovers over them.

Sound: Add sound effects to each key to make it more realistic. You can trigger audio when keys are clicked or pressed.

Animations: Consider adding subtle animations when keys are pressed or released to create a dynamic and engaging user experience.

Responsive Design: Ensure that your piano board and keys adapt well to different screen sizes, including mobile devices.
